# Summary of a finding
1. Univariate Exploration
For this research I used bike_share_for_all_trip column. According to the what I found on the data, definitely "No" is from majority of the people. As a result of this, we figured that majority (90.39%) of people did not share the bike ride.
2. Bivariate Exploration
As a result from a research, male gender holds lowest average duration sec compared to other two genders. In a slight difference (2.1) female group had highest duration_sec in average. In addition to this. I also noticed that male group had significantly lower in max rate compared to other two gender group.
3. Multivariate Exploration
I made a research on how each user type's duration in min varies in each day of the week. I Even with the glance of my visulization, it is cleary conclude that user type cusomter's duration in min is relatively higher then user type subscriber's duration in min. You can also see that on Saturday and Sunday presents relatively higher average duration in min compare to other day of the week.
# Dataset
Ford Go Bike was millions of datasets which includes following features: duration_sec (int64) 1 start_time (datetime64) 2 end_time (datetime64) 3 start_station_id (int64) 4 start_station_name (object) 5 start_station_latitude (float64) 6 start_station_longitude (float64) 7 end_station_id (int64) 8 end_station_name (object) 9 end_station_latitude (float64) 10 end_station_longitude (float64) 11 bike_id (int64) 12 user_type (category) 13 member_birth_year (int64) 14 member_gender (category) 15 bike_share_for_all_trip (category) 16 member_age (int64).
Although couple of the features are spreaded by me for varity, most of these features were already included in the data set.
# Key insights
For this presentation, I mainly focused on relationship between member’s age, how long they ride a bike (duration time), if they share a bike ride, user type and member’s gender. As a result of these researches, I found our multiple facts from this dataset.
People tend to not share the bike riding. I think it is common phenomenon because many customers tends to ride the bike for their won and not much likely sharing the bike with others.
Male member tends to ride bike less then other and female gender group. it was little interesting that male group ride the bike relatively less in sec then other and female gender groups. On the other hand, female and other gender group ride the bike equally same in duration in sec.
User type customer are more likely to spend more time in bike riding then subscribers in every day of a week. Also customers and subscribers tend to spend more time on bike riding during weekends. According to the result from dataset, customer group spends more time on bike riding then subscribers on every day of a week. There was a big difference in duration in min between customers and subscribers. Lastly I noticed during weekends both customer and subscriber’s spends more time in bike riding, which is predictable that people can spend more time on bike riding on weekends.
To make each group distinctive on a graph, I used color features to easily interpret and deliver to the audience. No matter what type of graph it is color distinction was very helpful in many way to present the research to the audience.
